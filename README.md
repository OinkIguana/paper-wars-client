# Paper Wars (Client)

The Paper Wars client is able to make requests to the Paper Wars server in a type-safe and
consistent manner. It is also able to perform some of the operations the server can, so that the
client is able to provide as much information to the players as needed.

Designed to be embedded in a native front-end, this client can be compiled to WASM or C library.
